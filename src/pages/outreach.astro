  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About RatLab</h2>
  <p>
    RatLab (Radio Transients Laboratory) is a research group at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile 
    focused on the detection and analysis of radio transient events, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and pulsars. 
    The group collaborates with observatories like ALMA and the Effelsberg Observatory, employing machine learning 
    and deep learning techniques to identify signals in heterogeneous datasets.
